/*Using only three stacks (source, sorted, and losers), sort a random sequence of
numbers by first placing the numbers on the source stack. Assume the number on
the top of the source is the largest, and push it on the sorted stack. Continue
to pop the source stack comparing it with the top of the sorted stack. Whichever
number is the smallest, pop it from its stack and push it onto the on the
losers’ stack. Once the source stack is empty, repeat the process using the
losers’ stack as the source stack, and use the source stack as the losers’
stack. The algorithm completes when all the numbers have been placed into the
winners’ stack
